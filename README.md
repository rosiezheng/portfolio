Portfolio for the course Computational Musicology - Juliette de Waal (12348759) <br/>

Some time ago I heard a song named 'a Fifth of Beethoven' by Walter Murphy, and I really liked it. It is a disco instrumental song based on Beethoven's Symphony No. 5. I thought using famous classical music pieces to create new songs of another genre is a really cool concept. So I did some research and discovered that there are many more famous songs that are based and inspired on a classical piece of music, also songs I know for a long time but never knew that they have a classical origin.<br/>
My corpus includes classical pieces and their linked new songs. I have found 25 pairs, so 50 songs in total.<br/>
I think that this corpus makes really interesting comparisments possible, on different levels.<br/>
For example between the songs based on the classical songs. What are the differences and similarities between these songs? Is the classical input used in the same way? Is there an common genre?<br/>
But of course exploring relation between the song based on a classic song and the original classical song itself is really interesting. To what extent do you see the original classical back in the new songs? In which way is the original song adapted in de new song? Which changes are made? Maybe the tempo changed or other instruments are used.<br/>
There are pairs of tracks in the corpus, like 'I can' – Nas/'Für Elise' -Beethoven and 'A fifth of Beethoven'-Woody/ Beethoven's Fifth Symphony- Beethoven, in which the relation with the origin classical song is very obvious. But there are also pairs in the corpus in which the original songs are more subtly included, like 'Grace Kelly'- Mika /  'Largo Al Factotum'- Rossini. <br/>
It's important that I define my research a bit more, but I think this is a really interesting and fun corpus to explore with enough possibilities.

## Peer Review
Super fun corpus! I really like it. I believe it is possible to expand this corpus in the following weeks for sure since there are probably more than 25 classical songs which are covered. Regarding the criteria for the portfolio, your submission seems strongest for Corpus Selection since it is a creative, focused, and manageable topic that addresses potentially significant yet previously less-explored musicological aspects. I find it hard to select a criteria for which your submission seems weakeast since I can imagine with all criteria that it could work out very well. Maybe Representation could be a difficulty since it could be hard to convert relevant information into various mathematical forms. In classical music, you mostly have no words so that is a measurement that cannot be included. When a song is covered, mostly the melody is the same. How are you going to put this into table/graphs etc.? An idea could be a correlation matrix.
